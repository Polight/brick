# Brick

> The minimalist reactive web-component

Brick is:
- üëô minimalist: 74 lines of readable code (non-optimised, uncompressed, no cheating)
- üå± low dependency: its single third-party is the minimalist [Petit-Dom](https://github.com/yelouafi/petit-dom) which itself has no dependency
- ‚ôªÔ∏è reactive: updating the state recalculate the Virtual Dom when needed.
- üöÄ fast: using virtual dom through a thin layer makes it close to bare-metal.
- üíß simple: that's [Vanilla](http://vanilla-js.com/), there isn't much to know, it's a raw class to extend; no magic ‚ú®.

### Getting started

Here's a fully working example with no install.

Copy-paste the following in an __index.html__ and run it in localhost:

```html
<hello-world name="earth">

<script type=module>
  import { h, Component } from '//unpkg.com/@polight/brick/lib'

  class HelloWorld extends Component {
    init() { this.state = { name: 'world' } }

    toggleName() { this.state.name = 'gaia' }

    get vdom() {
      return ({ state }) => [
        h('p', {}, `Hello ${state.name}`),
        h('button', { onclick: this.toggleName.bind(this) }, `toggle`),
      ]
    }
  }

  customElements.define('hello-world', HelloWorld)
</script>
```

There isn't much to explain, but let's detail a little:

- `<hello-world name="earth">` is a web-component. That's native. `name="earth"` will be sent to the component as `{ state: 'earth' }`
- `init() { this.state = { name: 'world' } }` declares the `state` with it's default values. Also, anything that is declared in the state‚Äîand only what is declared here‚Äîwill be reactive
- `toggleName` is a custom method that will be called on click
- `get vdom()` is the property that should return a function reprenting your HTML. That function is itself called passing the `state` argument. It should returns a virtual-dom. If you know [virtual-dom](https://medium.com/@deathmood/how-to-write-your-own-virtual-dom-ee74acc13060), [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [elm](https://elm-lang.org/), this writing will be familiar
- `customElements.define('hello-world', HelloWorld)` that's the native way in HTML to declare the web-component



### Documentation

The best documentation is [reading the code](./lib/Component.js).

However a couple of extra nodes might be handy.

#### state

this object is made available to the virtual-dom (and CSS styles).
It can be reactive (when declared in the init) and can be updated by the app.

State is fed the following way:
1. declared in the `init()` with the default values
2. attributes of the element in the HTML will overwrite the defaults
3. changing values in the object or on the component attributes will update the values and re-render the component.

#### init()

You can initialize whatever you need here.
That's a convenient instance to declare your reactive `state` object.
When declaring your `state` here, it's properties will be made reactive.

#### vdom()

Must return a function that returns a string, an array or a `h()` instance.
The structure of `h()` takes 3 arguments:
`h(<html element (string)>, <attributes (object)>, <children (array, string, or h())>)`.

#### vstyle()

Same as `vdom()`, but returning a CSS style node.

```js
get vstyle() {
  return ({ state }) => h('style', {}, 'p{ color: red }')
}
```

#### connected()

A convenient method to call when the component is attached to the dom.

#### disconnected()

A convenient method to call when the component is removed from the dom.
