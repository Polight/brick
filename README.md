# LEGO: Modern Web-Components

LEGO (_Lightweight Embedded Gluten-free Objects_) is a thin layer to build web-component bricks that are easy to digest for your browser.

> No dependency, no compilation!â„¢

## Create your element

```html
<my-component>Content of my component</my-component>

<script type=module>
  import component from './dist/lego.js'

  component('my-component', {
      template: '<h1>${this.user.name}</h1><p>Age: ${this.user.age}</p><slot />',
      style: '<style>h1 {color: ${this.color}}</style>'
      context: { user: { name: 'John Doe', age: 42 }, color: 'green' },
    }
  })
</script>
```

> Open the index.html with a recent web browser to view this example.

In 4 lines you created a full powered web-component!


## Just a thin layer

It is still fully compatible with native _custom elements_. No magic behind the scene,
no complexity, just a couple of useful methods to write native web components easier.

You may add the [WebComponentsJS polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs) to increase browser compatibility.



## Available properties

**template**: The HTML content of the component. [Web-components slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots#Adding_flexibility_with_slots) and other native web-components properties are fully available. Variables are interpreted from the `context` property. Ex: `${this.myprop}` will read from `context.myprop`.

**style**: The CSS style you want to incorporate. Variables are interpreted from context just like in the _template_ property.

**context**: object that will be made available to the _template_ and the _style_ properties.


## Available methods

**render(context)**: Refresh the component, overriding the context.
